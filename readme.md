# Replication Package

This repository accompanies the paper **"Building smart agents faster: A low-code approach for the automatic personalization of conversational agents"**. It provides everything needed to reproduce the web-based tooling, generated agents, and user study described in the publication.

The material is organized into two main parts:

1. **demo/** – Contains the code to run the web-based modeling editor, the backend responsible for generating the end-to-end conversational pipeline, and the agent framework required to execute the generated agents.
2. **study/** – Includes all study-related artifacts, such as participant instructions, the questionnaire, the empty response template, and the anonymized completed responses.

Use the folders above as entry points depending on whether you want to run the demo system or inspect the study materials.
